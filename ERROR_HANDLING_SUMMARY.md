# Error Handling Improvements Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive error handling for all file operations across the J2 Magic Wand extension codebase.

## Changes by File

### 1. extension.ts
- **loadAllConfigs()**: Added try-catch for file reading and JSON parsing, with error logging and user notifications
- **saveAllConfigs()**: Added try-catch for directory creation and file writing operations
- **goToDefinition command**: Added error handling for YAML file reading and parsing
- **manageService command**: Added error handling for config file reading
- **Show All Saved Configurations**: Added error handling for file operations
- **getAllVsixFiles()**: Added file existence check and individual file error handling within the directory scan

### 2. diagnostics.ts
- **loadPlaceholders()**: Added try-catch blocks for:
  - File reading operations with specific error messages
  - YAML parsing with user notifications for parsing errors

### 3. placeholderProvider.ts
- **loadPlaceholders()**: Added try-catch blocks for:
  - File reading operations with error logging
  - YAML parsing with error logging

### 4. renderView.ts
- **changeEnvironment message handler**: Added error handling for config file reading and parsing
- **loadPlaceholders()**: Added error handling for file reading and YAML parsing
- **getWebviewContent()**: Added try-catch for HTML template file reading with fallback error page
- **Config file operations**: Added proper error handling for JSON parsing

### 5. hotReload.ts
- **startWatching()**: Wrapped file watcher creation in try-catch
- **restoreWorkspaceState()**: Added error handling for:
  - JSON parsing of state file
  - Individual editor restoration with warning logs
  - Active editor restoration with warning logs
- **saveWorkspaceState()**: Already had error handling

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Error Handling Pattern**: All file operations now follow a consistent pattern:
   ```typescript
   try {
       // File operation
   } catch (error) {
       logger.error('Descriptive message:', error);
       // Optional: User notification for critical errors
   }
   ```

2. **Graceful Degradation**: The extension continues to function even if some file operations fail

3. **User Feedback**: Critical errors that affect functionality show user-friendly error messages

4. **Detailed Logging**: All errors are logged with context for debugging

5. **Specific Error Messages**: Error messages include the file path and operation that failed

## Error Types Handled

- File not found (fs.existsSync checks before operations)
- File read failures (fs.readFileSync)
- Directory creation failures (fs.mkdirSync)
- JSON parsing errors (JSON.parse)
- YAML parsing errors (yaml.load)
- File system permission errors
- Malformed data errors

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Check Before Read**: Using fs.existsSync before attempting to read files
2. **Separate Read and Parse**: Reading file content and parsing are in separate try-catch blocks where appropriate
3. **Continue on Error**: Loop iterations continue when individual file operations fail
4. **Meaningful Error Messages**: Including file paths and operation context in error messages
5. **Appropriate Error Levels**: Using logger.error for failures and logger.warn for recoverable issues
